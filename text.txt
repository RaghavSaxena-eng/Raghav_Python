The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
How razorback-jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts!
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt.
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex!
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
The vixen jumped quickly on her foe beryl.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
Crazy Fredrick bought many very exquisite opal jewels.
